Name: Submission of Data Structure - LinkedList

Assignment-14

Date: 13-02-25

Summary:

Stacks: Use for nested/reversible problems (e.g., recursion, undo), handle size limits to avoid overflow, ensure atomic operations in multi-threading, and use Java's collections for robustness.
Queues: Use for FIFO tasks (e.g., BFS, task scheduling), choose the right type (simple, deque, or priority queue), and handle underflow/overflow properly.
Concurrency: For both stacks and queues, use thread-safe implementations like ConcurrentLinkedDeque or BlockingQueue in multi-threaded environments.
Optimizations: Track min/max with auxiliary stacks, use lazy deletion for priority queues, and avoid unnecessary checks or polling empty queues.
